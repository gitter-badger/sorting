sorting
=======
This creates a random array of four numbers, bubble sorts them, and when the start button is clicked they are displayed in order as colored divs.

I worked with John on this assignment and we were able to figure out a lot of the code for the sorting together. Although since then I rewrote the sorting code with fewer lines.
